 This project aims to develop tools and models for modeling sky irradiance captured by fisheye cameras (Allsky). The aim is to provide a collaborative platform for exploring different methods of projection, distortion correction and irradiance estimation from hemispheric images.

## Introduction

Fisheye cameras offer a unique hemispherical field of view, making them useful for a variety of applications such as cloud cover studies, solar potential estimation, robotic navigation and environmental analysis. However, the distortion inherent in these lenses and the projection of the celestial sphere onto an image plane pose challenges for quantitative irradiance analysis.

The aim of this project is to create an open source toolbox for :

* **Model the projection of sky irradiance onto fisheye images**.
* Implement distortion correction methods.
* Provide algorithms for estimating irradiance from image data.
* Facilitate the comparison and validation of different approaches.

## Features

Planned functionalities include:

* **Implementation of different fisheye projection models** (e.g., equidistant, equiangle, orthographic, stereographic).
* Tools for correcting fisheye image distortion.
* Methods for mapping image pixels to sky directions.
* Integration of sky irradiance models** (e.g. sun-based models, isotropic models).
* View projected irradiance data.
* Application examples and case studies.
* Possibility of integrating data from external sensors (e.g. IMU, GPS, etc.).
